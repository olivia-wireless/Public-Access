### How to use this service

This service can be used to remotely access your hardware. All you need to know is the barcode (or ICCID) of the SIM card and the port on the hardware you would like to access.
Preconditions

- Your card is provisioned with a public IP route
- Your device is successfully connected to the network
- The APN in your device is set correctly. Your APN is printed on the packing slip that came with the SIM card.
- Some devices are protected with an IP whitelist and cannot be accessed from all source IPs.

### Define your personal URL

Obtain the barcode of your SIM card from our platform and open the port you want to access remotely on your hardware. With these variables, you can determine your personal URL.

The URL structure for this service is:

https://access.oliviawireless.io/id/{SIM barcode}/{port}/

_Example: https://access.oliviawireless.io/id/8912345678901234567/80/_

Make sure to use this exact format. Once access is granted by our server, you are redirected to the correct SIM and port.


### Tips and tricks

- If you are not sure what port to enter, please try port 80
- When possible, please only use random ports on your device.
- You can use this service for any port on your device.
- You can also set port forwarding on your router and use that to access hardware in the LAN network.
